> [!ATTENTION]
**startle** is _alpha_ and should be considered unstable as its interface is fluid ðŸ˜…, consider pinning to a version.

## Showcase

</div>

**startle** lets you transform a python function into a command line entry point, e.g:

`wc.py`:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Literal

from startle import start


def word_count(
    fname: Path, /, kind: Literal["word", "char"] = "word", *, verbose: bool = False
) -> None:
    """
    Count the number of words or characters in a file.

    Args:
        fname: The file to count.
        kind: Whether to count words or characters.
        verbose: Whether to print additional info.
    """

    text = open(fname).read()
    count = len(text.split()) if kind == "word" else len(text)

    print(f"{count} {kind}s in {fname}" if verbose else count)


start(word_count)
```

When you invoke `start`, it will construct an argparser (based on type hints and docstring),
parse the arguments, and invoke `word_count`.

### Multiple commands

You can invoke `start()` with a list of functions instead of a single function.
In this case, functions are made available as _commands_ with their own arguments
and options in your CLI:

`calc.py`:

```py
from startle import start


def add(ns: list[int]) -> None:
    """
    Add numbers together.

    Args:
        ns: The numbers to add together.
    """
    total = sum(ns)
    print(f"{' + '.join(map(str, ns))} = {total}")


def sub(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    """
    Subtract a number from another.

    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number
    """
    print(f"{a} - {b} = {a - b}")


def mul(ns: list[int]) -> None:
    """
    Multiply numbers together.

    Args:
        ns: The numbers to multiply together.
    """
    total = 1
    for n in ns:
        total *= n
    print(f"{' * '.join(map(str, ns))} = {total}")


def div(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    """
    Divide a number by another.

    Args:
        a: The dividend.
        b: The divisor.
    """
    print(f"{a} / {b} = {a / b}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    start([add, sub, mul, div])

```

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="img/calc-help-dark.svg" width="100%">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="img/calc-help-light.svg" width="100%">
  <img src="img/calc-help-light.svg" width="100%">
</picture>

In the invocation `python calc.py add 1 2 3`, first argument is `add`, which causes the execution
to dispatch to the `add` command (i.e. `add()` function). The rest of the arguments (`1 2 3`) then
are passed along to `add()`.


## Motivation

**startle** is inspired by [Typer](https://github.com/fastapi/typer), and [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire),
but aims to be _non-intrusive_, to have stronger type support, and to have saner defaults.
Thus, some decisions are done differently:

- Use of positional-only or keyword-only argument separators (`/`, `*`, see PEP 570, 3102) are naturally translated into positional arguments or options.
  See above example ([wc.py](https://github.com/oir/startle/blob/main/examples/wc.py)).
- Like Typer and unlike Fire, type hints strictly determine how the individual arguments are parsed and typed.
- Short forms (e.g. `-k`, `-v` above) are automatically provided based on the initial of the argument.
- Variable length arguments are more intuitively handled.
  You can use `--things a b c` (in addition to `--things=a --things=b --things=c`).
  See [example](https://github.com/oir/startle/blob/main/examples/cat.py).
- Like Typer and unlike Fire, help is simply printed and not displayed in pager mode by default, so you can keep referring to it as you type your command.
- Like Fire and unlike Typer, docstrings determine the description of each argument in the help text, instead of having to individually add extra type annotations. This allows for a very non-intrusive design, you can adopt (or un-adopt) **startle** with no changes to your functions.
- `*args` but also `**kwargs` are supported, to parse unknown arguments as well as unknown options (`--unk-key unk-val`).
  See [example](https://github.com/oir/startle/blob/main/examples/search_gh.py).
